Inline Style Extension for the HTMLWebpackPlugin
========================================

This package extends the [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) functionality by inlining existing styles to HTML elements using [inline-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inline-css).

You might want to use this to automate email generation with webpack.

The following input provided by the HTMLWebpackPlugin:
```css
.my-class {
    color:red;
}
```

```html
<div class="my-class"></div>
```

will result in
```html
<div style="color: red;"></div>
```

Installation
------------
Install the plugin with npm:
```shell
$ npm install --save-dev inline-style-ext-html-webpack-plugin
```

Install the plugin with yarn:
```shell
$ yarn add --dev inline-style-ext-html-webpack-plugin
```

Basic Usage
-----------
Require the plugin in your webpack config:

```javascript
const InlineStyleExtHtmlWebpackPlugin = require('inline-style-ext-html-webpack-plugin');
```

Add the plugin to your webpack config as follows:

```javascript
{
	...
	plugins: [
	    new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
	    new InlineStyleExtHtmlWebpackPlugin(),
	]
	...
}
```
